# SignalFx Java Agent

This is the SignalFx Java Agent, a JVM agent to automatically instrument your
Java application to capture and report distributed traces to SignalFx.

The SignalFx Java Agent automatically configures an OpenTracing-compatible
tracer to capture and export trace spans. It also installs this tracer
as the OpenTracing `GlobalTracer` to enable additional custom instrumentation.

# Usage

The SignalFx Java Agent uses a few environment variables for its configuration.
You should set your application's service name via `SIGNALFX_SERVICE_NAME`:

```
$ export SIGNALFX_SERVICE_NAME=my-app
$ java -javaagent:signalfx-tracing.jar <rest of command-line arguments...>
```

This invocation assumes that you have a [locally deployed SignalFx Smart
Agent](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/apm/apm-deployment/smart-agent.html)
accessable on `localhost`.  If you want to send traces directly to the Smart
Gateway or if your Smart Agent is only accessible on a different host (e.g. in
a containerized environment), set the trace host via the `SIGNALFX_AGENT_HOST`
envvar to the approprate value (default is `localhost`).  You can override the
entire trace target URL with the `SIGNALFX_ENDPOINT_URL` envvar (default:
`http://localhost:9080/v1/trace`).

See [our example app that uses
this](https://github.com/signalfx/tracing-examples/tree/master/java-agent) for
more details on how to use and configure the SignalFx Java Agent.

# License and Versioning

The SignalFx Java Agent for Tracing is released under the terms of the Apache
Software License version 2.0. See [the license file](./LICENSE) for more details.

SignalFx's Java agent is a fork of the [DataDog Java APM
project](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-java); for the time being, the agent
will be versioned in conjunction with the DataDog APM agent that it is based on,
with a SignalFx-specific patch version at the end, of the form `-sfxN`, where `N`
is the SignalFx patch starting at `0`. For example, the DD APM agent version
`0.20.0` would be initially released by us as `0.20.0-sfx0`.  We will attempt to
merge in changes from the upstream on a regular basis, especially after releases.
